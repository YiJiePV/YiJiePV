# Hi there 👋. My name is Karena and I am a young programmer currently studying computer science at Seattle Pacific University.
About the profile: The repos in my profile are mostly finished school projects I did over the past 4-5 years. However, that can change as I start my own projects or start contributing to open source projects.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer science at Seattle Pacific University
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything. I am undecided on which area I want to work in, but I am currently growing an interest in AI and Machine Learning.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with improving my coding and communication skills and exploring various career paths in computer science.
