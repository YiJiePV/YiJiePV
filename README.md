# Hi there ðŸ‘‹. My name is Karena and I am a young programmer working towards a M.S in artificial intelligence at the University of Texas at Austin.
About the profile: The repos in my profile are mostly finished school projects I did over the past 5-6 years. However, that can change as I start my own projects or start contributing to open source projects.

- ðŸŒ± I graduated from Seattle Pacific University with a bachelor's degree in computer science!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything. I am undecided on which area I want to work in, but I am currently growing an interest in AI and Machine Learning.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with improving my coding and communication skills and exploring various career paths in computer science.
