# Hi there ðŸ‘‹. My name is Karena and I am a young programmer currently studying computer science at Seattle Pacific University.
About the profile: The repos in my profile are mostly finished school projects I did over the past 4 years. However, that can change as I start my own projects or start contributing to open source projects.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning computer science at Seattle Pacific University
